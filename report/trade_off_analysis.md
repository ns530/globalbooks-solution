# Reflective Trade-Off Analysis: SOA Refactoring of GlobalBooks Inc.

## Benefits of SOA Approach
- **Scalability**: Autonomous services allow independent scaling (e.g., Payments during peak loads), improving performance over the monolithic system.
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service (e.g., Shipping) do not cascade, enhancing reliability.
- **Reusability**: Services like CatalogService can be reused by multiple clients, reducing code duplication.
- **Interoperability**: SOAP/REST standards enable integration with diverse systems.

## Challenges of SOA Approach
- **Integration Complexity**: Coordinating via RabbitMQ and BPEL increases overhead compared to monolith.
- **Distributed Systems Issues**: Latency, message routing, and synchronization add debugging difficulty.
- **Governance Overhead**: Versioning, SLAs, and security require ongoing management.
- **Development Cost**: Initial setup of multiple services and infrastructure is resource-intensive.

Overall, SOA provides long-term agility but demands careful planning to mitigate complexity.
