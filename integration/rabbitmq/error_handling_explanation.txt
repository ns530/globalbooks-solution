Explanation for Tasks 10-11: Integration and Error-Handling Strategy

Integration:
- PaymentsService and ShippingService consume messages from RabbitMQ queues.
- OrdersService publishes to orders_exchange with routing keys (e.g., order.payment for payments, order.shipping for shipping).
- Producers: OrdersService sends order details asynchronously.
- Consumers: PaymentsService processes payment, ShippingService handles shipment.

Error-Handling and Dead-Letter Routing:
- Queues have TTL (60 seconds) and dead-letter exchange.
- Failed messages (e.g., payment declined) are routed to dead_letter_queue for manual review.
- Strategy: Retry with exponential backoff, log errors, alert admins for critical failures.
- Ensures reliability in async messaging, preventing message loss during service outages.
