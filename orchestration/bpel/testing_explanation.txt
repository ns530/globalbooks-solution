Explanation for Task 9: Deployment and Testing on BPEL Engine

Deployment:
1. Package the BPEL process (place_order.bpel), WSDL files, and deploy.xml into a ZIP file.
2. Deploy to Apache ODE by uploading the ZIP via the ODE console (http://localhost:8080/ode).
3. ODE will parse the process and make it available as a web service.

Testing:
1. Use SOAP UI to test the deployed process.
2. Create a new SOAP project in SOAP UI with the process WSDL (generated by ODE).
3. Send a placeOrder request with order details.
4. Monitor ODE logs for process execution: receive → invoke CatalogService → invoke OrdersService → reply.
5. Verify responses and check for errors in the ODE console.
6. Screenshots of execution can be taken from the ODE process instance view.

This demonstrates the orchestration of services in a real BPEL engine under load scenarios.
